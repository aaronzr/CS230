    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of our project is to produce summaries of psychotherapy sessions to aid therapists and their clients.  As a preliminary milestone, we intended to apply an *unsupervised* summarization pipeline proposed by [Padmakumar and Saran](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~asaran/reports/summarization.pdf) and implemented by [Chauhan](https://medium.com/jatana/unsupervised-text-summarization-using-sentence-embeddings-adb15ce83db1) to psychotherapy data. Our plan was to use this unsupervised method as a baseline and compare it with deep learning methods using ROUGE-2 scores. However, we have been unable to access the [psychotherapy transcripts dataset](https://alexanderstreet.com/products/counseling-and-psychotherapy-transcripts-series) we originally intended to use. Here we use a subset of the [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) for the purpose of pipeline development.\n",
